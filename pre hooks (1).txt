Navigate to your Git repository.
Create a file named pre-push (without any file extension) in the .git/hooks/ directory within your repository.
Open the pre-push file in a text editor and add the following script:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
while read local_ref local_sha remote_ref remote_sha
do
   # Iterate through each file
   for file in $(git diff --name-only $remote_sha $local_sha)
   do
       # Check if the file contains any comments
       if grep -q -E '^\s*//' $file; then
           echo "Comments found in $file. Proceeding with push."
       else
           echo "Error: No comments found in $file. Canceling push."
           exit 1
       fi
   done
done
# If the script reaches here, it means comments were found in all files
exit 0
Save and close the file. Make it executable:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
Now, when you try to push changes, the script will check each modified file for comments. If any file lacks comments, the push will be canceled.
Keep in mind that this is a basic example, and you might need to adapt it based on your specific requirements and the comment style used in your files. Additionally, it won't differentiate between types of comments (e.g., single-line vs. multi-line comments). Adjust the script accordingly to fit your needs.
