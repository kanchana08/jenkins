[] Developers use shared libraries to avoid writing the same code from scratch for multiple projects.Shared libraries share code across development projects, thus optimizing the software development life cycle. 
[] in github repository will crete one directry vars, inside that will crete .groovy file with small and big latter (ex: hellowWorld.groovy)
[] code :     def call() {
sh"docker build -t image:latest ."
  sh "docker images"
  sh "pwd"
  sh "ls"
}


[] pipeline code :   @Library('my-shared-library')_
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('clone') {
            steps {
                checkOut()
            }
        }
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                hellowWorld()
               }
        }
        
    }
}


[] we need to configure, in manege jenkins select system, then select Global Pipeline Libraries, file the name
,and in deafault version git master/main or branch and git repo and credentiales.
