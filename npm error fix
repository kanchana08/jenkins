if we get npm installation issues

like: npm ERR! code ENOTEMPTY
      npm ERR! syscall rename 
      npm ERR! code ENOTEMPTY: directory not empty

[] go to server 
[] go to particular path
[] check npm install  becouse if it run in server. after build the job again it will get success again.
[] in server also we get same error
[] npm cache clear --force   
[] rm -rf /home/jenkins/worcspace/ng-fdt/node_moduls
[] rm -rf /home/jenkins/worcspace/ng-fdt/package_lock.json
[] npm install
