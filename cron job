crontab:
If you want any job or work to be scheduled on your Linux or Unix Operation System,
then the Linux ‘Crontab’ Command will be a popular one. The ‘Crontab’ Command on Linux works in the system’s background.
The ‘Crontab’ Linux Command goes on to check the time on the device and when a particular time arrives, it performs pre-defined tasks automatically.


command:
[] crontab -e   ----> it will move inside the cron file.
first we need to create shell script for this, in that script we will mention execution commands 

  [] crontab -e 
 in this file we will mention the automation timings and shell script path 
  ex: * * * * * /var/opt/example.sh  (it means every minut it will execute the shell script)

  [] cat /var/opt/example.sh
  #! /bin/bash
  cd /var/opt
  zip zipfile.zip /var/opt/crontest/*
