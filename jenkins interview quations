1. Jenkins Fundamentals & Setup:

    Explain the Jenkins master-agent architecture and its benefits.
    How do you secure a Jenkins instance? Discuss authentication, authorization, and secret management.
    Describe the process of setting up a Jenkins pipeline from scratch, including SCM integration and build triggers.

2. Jenkins Pipelines (Declarative & Scripted):

    Differentiate between Declarative and Scripted Pipelines, providing use cases for each.
    How do you manage and reuse pipeline code using Shared Libraries?
    Explain how to handle errors and implement retry mechanisms within a Jenkins pipeline.
    How do you pass parameters between stages or jobs in a pipeline?

3. Plugins & Integrations:

    Discuss common Jenkins plugins you have used and their functionalities (e.g., Git, Maven, SonarQube, Docker, Kubernetes).
    How do you integrate Jenkins with external tools like SonarQube for code quality analysis or Slack/Teams for notifications?
    Explain how to manage plugin dependencies and updates in a stable manner.

4. Advanced Concepts & Best Practices:

    How do you optimize Jenkins performance for large-scale environments? (e.g., distributed builds, agent allocation).

Describe your approach to managing credentials and sensitive information in Jenkins securely.
How do you implement a rollback mechanism in a Jenkins pipeline? 
Discuss strategies for monitoring Jenkins health and performance.
What are some common anti-patterns in Jenkins usage, and how do you avoid them?

5. Troubleshooting & Problem Solving:

    You encounter a failed Jenkins build. Describe your systematic approach to troubleshooting and identifying the root cause.
    How would you handle a situation where a Jenkins agent becomes unresponsive?
    Explain how to debug a failing Jenkins pipeline.

6. Scenario-Based Questions:

    Design a Jenkins pipeline for a microservices application with multiple repositories and deployment environments.
    How would you implement Continuous Delivery for a mobile application using Jenkins?
    Imagine a scenario where a critical build fails in production. What steps would you take using Jenkins to mitigate the issue and prevent future occurrences?

7. How do you integrate Jenkins with other tools in a DevOps ecosystem?
ANS:- Jenkins integrates with a wide range of tools through its extensive plugin ecosystem:

    Version Control: Git, SVN (using respective plugins).
    Build Automation: Maven, Gradle, Ant.
    Testing Frameworks: JUnit, Selenium, JMeter.
    Containerization: Docker.
    Orchestration: Kubernetes.
    Code Quality: SonarQube.
    Artifact Management: Nexus, Artifactory.
